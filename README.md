# Atomic Models
This is a collection of 3D-printable models that fit together and allow you to connect them thus creating many different molecular models. 

The size of the atoms is relative to the size of the carbon atom (Diameter of which is 30 mm).

Have fun!

### Current models:
- Oxygen
- Carbon
- Hydrogen

### Current bonds
 - single covalent
 -  double covalent *(fits the connection between C and O)*

***p.s.** this was created as a quickly made project (and i am no chemistry expert), so there are likely many aspects that haven't been thought through + many mistakes. I'm also new to open-suorce, so please be gentle :) *
